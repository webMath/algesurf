## Parametric Equations
The inspiration for using the Three.js Parametric Geometry came from playing with the Three.js [NURBS example]( http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/#webgl_geometry_nurbs ). 

The equation samples are, so far, sourced from Jurgen Meier's wonderful [Parametric Surfaces tutorials]( http://www.3d-meier.de/tut3/Seite0.html ).


## Marching Cubes 
[Marching cubes]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes ) is a computer graphics algorithm for extracting a polygonal mesh of an isosurface from a three-dimensional scalar field (sometimes called voxels).
The desire and inspiration for the use of marching cubes comes from the very beautiful Three.js [Marching Cubes example]( http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/#webgl_marchingcubes ).
The code in this demo is extremely complicated. AlgeSurf uses the far simpler code

Paul Bourke's [Polygonise]( http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/ ).

## Marching Cubes Sample Equations
The first equations we came across were on [Jalape.no]( jalope.no ) and again [Paul Burke]( http://paulbourke.net/geometry/ ),
but the "mother lode" of equations are sourced from Herwig Hauser's 
[Algebraic Surfaces]( http://homepage.univie.ac.at/herwig.hauser/bildergalerie/gallery.html ) online gallery

The next library we plan to look at for fresh equations is R Morris's [SingSurf]( http://www.singsurf.org/singsurf/SingSurf.html )

## Function Graphs
The inspiration for taking a Three.js plane and budging its vertices up and down came from 
Jaume Sanchez's [Blocky Earth]( http://www.clicktorelease.com/code/blocky_earth/ ).


## Generally
And none of this would be possible without Three.js]( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js ), [Mr.doob]( mrdoob.com ) and WebGL.
